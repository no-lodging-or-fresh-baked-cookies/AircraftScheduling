<p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto">The Maintain Aircraft Make and Model screen allows the user to
modify the makes, models and type complexity of the aircraft maintained by the database. 
The following controls are provided:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><p style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto">Aircraft Makes - displays the current aircraft makes in
    the database. The following fields are provided to change the makes:<ul>
      <li><p style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto">Delete - delete the selected aircraft make.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto">Add Make - type the name of the new make to 
        add to the database.</p>

      <li><p style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto">Delete - delete the selected aircraft model.</p>

    model complexity in the database.
    </p>

    <p style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto">
        To maintain currency for an aircraft a pilot must fly the most complex aircraft they wish to fly
        within 90 days (instructor, instrument and private pilots with more than 200 hours) or 60
        days (private pilot with less than 200 hours). The complexities set by this screen, tell
        the program which aircraft model is more complex than another aircraft model or which
        aircraft model can only clear itself.
    </p>
        <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto">The complexity is used to determine which aircraft model
        flight test will apply to another aircraft model. A complexity of 1 will clear a complexity
        of 2, a complexity of 2 will clear a complexity 3 but not complexity 1, etc. The
        complexity numbers may be equal if the aircraft complexity is the same. A complexity of 0
        means that aircraft flight test will clear only that aircraft model.</p>
        
        <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto">In the example shown above, the aircraft models
        PA24, AA1, M20J and BE19 are all standalone complexity (complexity 0) so that none of
        these aircraft flight tests will satisify the flight test requirement for any other
        aircraft model and no other aircraft model will satisify these aircraft model flight tests.
        The P28R and C182R are the most complex aircraft models (complexity 2) and taking a flight 
        test in any aircraft of type P28R or C182R will satisfy the P28R, C182R, C182, P28A, C172, C152
        and BE23 flight test requirements. The C182 is the next most complex aircraft model (complexity 3) 
        and taking a flight test in any aircraft of type C182 will satisfy the C182, P28A, C172, C152
        and BE23 flight test requirements but not the P28R or C182R flight test requirement. The P28A and C172 
        are the next most complex aircraft models (complexity 5) and taking a flight test in any
        aircraft of type P28A or C172 will satisfy the P28A,
        C172, C152 and BE23 flight test requirements but not the P28R, C182R or C182
        flight test requirement. The C152 is the next most complex aircraft model (complexity 6)
        and taking a flight test in any aircraft of type C152 will satisfy the C152 and BE23
        flight test requirements but not the P28R, C182R, C182, P28A or C172 flight test requirements. 
        The BE23 is the next most complex aircraft model (complexity 7) and taking a flight test in any
        aircraft of type BE23 will satisfy the BE23 flight test requirements but not the P28R, C182R,
        C182, P28A, C172 or C152 flight test requirements.</p>
        
        <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto">The SIM and PCATD aircraft models are special types and
        the complexity of these two types cannot be changed. The SIM aircraft model is for a
        simulator as defined by the FAA. The PCATD aircraft model is for an FAA designated PCATD
        device. The major difference in the handling of the two types is that all instrument time
        logged in a simulator may be applied to instrument currency time for all pilots whereas
        the instrument time in a PCATD device can only be applied toward instrument training for
        instrument students.</p>
        
        <p style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto">
        In addition to setting the complexity of the aircraft
        types, the following controls are provided:

        </ul>

</ul>

<p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto" class="mvd-P-Note">Note: The flight test requirements
only apply to rental aircraft and not to privately owned aircraft.</p>

<p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto" class="mvd-P-Note">Note: The PCATD and SIM type complexities
    can not be changed.
