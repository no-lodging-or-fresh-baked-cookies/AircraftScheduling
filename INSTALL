To Install:

1.  Files in the AircraftScheduling directory are support files. The php files for the scheduling program
    are in the web directory. All files use a relative path so it should not matter what the directory
    is called or where it is stored.

2.  The img directory is the directory for the image files for the aircraft. The image new.jpg is 
    used in the day display to show that a new aircraft may be scheduled. If you are storing the images
    in another directory, you will have to change the path in the config.inc file.
    The naming convention for the images:

    Aircraft:  n_number.jpg is a picture of the aircraft from the outside.
               n_number_panel.jpg is a picture of the instrument panel/interior.

3.  Create Database:  mysqladmin create ScheduleDB (can be any name that you want, just make
    sure it is the same name in $db_database in SiteSpecific.inc).

4.  Create Tables and load data: mysql ScheduleDB < CreateEmptyAircraftSchedule.sql

5.  Set the login and configuration information for the database in the files config.inc 
    and SiteSpecific.inc.

6.  Starting file for the scheduler program is index.php.

7.  The new database only has one login and that is the administrator login: admin password: admin. There
    are no aircraft or instructors created.

8.  Create users and aircraft using the Admin from the toolbar.
